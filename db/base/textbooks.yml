    - Huxley’s bleak future prophesized in Brave New World was a capitalist civilization
      which had been reconstituted through scientific and psychological engineering,
      a world in which people are genetically designed to be passive and useful to
      the ruling class. Satirical and disturbing, Brave New World is set some 600
      years ahead, in “this year of stability, A.F. 632”--the A.F. standing for After
      Ford, meaning the godlike Henry Ford. “Community, Identity, Stability,” is the
      motto. Reproduction is controlled through genetic engineering, and people are
      bred into a rigid class system. As they mature, they are conditioned to be happy
      with the roles that society has created for them. The rest of their lives are
      devoted to the pursuit of pleasure through sex, recreational sports, the getting
      and having of material possessions, and taking a drug called Soma. Concepts
      such as family, freedom, love, and culture are considered grotesque. Against
      this backdrop, a young man known as John the Savage is brought to London from
      the remote desert of New Mexico. What he sees in the new civilization a “brave
      new world” (quoting Shakespeare’s The Tempest). However, ultimately, John challenges
      the basic premise of this society in an act that threatens and fascinates its
      citizens. Huxley uses his entire prowess to throw the idea of utopia into reverse,
      presenting us what is known as the “dystopian” novel. When Brave New World was
      written (1931), neither Hitler nor Stalin had risen to power. Huxley saw the
      enduring threat to society from the dark side of scientific and social progress,
      and mankind’s increasing appetite for simple amusement. Brave New World is a
      work that indicts the idea of progress for progress sake and is backed up with
      force and reason.

    - Early user interface (UI) practitioners were trained in cognitive psychology,
      from which UI design rules were based. But as the field evolves, designers enter
      the field from many disciplines. Practitioners today have enough experience
      in UI design that they have been exposed to design rules, but it is essential
      that they understand the psychology behind the rules in order to effectively
      apply them. In Designing with the Mind in Mind, Jeff Johnson, author of the
      best selling GUI Bloopers, provides designers with just enough background in
      perceptual and cognitive psychology that UI design guidelines make intuitive
      sense rather than being just a list of rules to follow. * The first practical,
      all-in-one source for practitioners on user interface design rules and why,
      when and how to apply them. * Provides just enough background into the reasoning
      behind interface design rules that practitioners can make informed decisions
      in every project. * Gives practitioners the insight they need to make educated
      design decisions when confronted with tradeoffs, including competing design
      rules, time constrictions, or limited resources.
